To run my code, all you need to do is run all from Proj3.ipynb. Please do not change the structure of folders and files you obtain from the .zip file.

images: Contains images I procure for use in this project

imm_face_db: Images and correspondence points from Danes population set

out: Frames from `morph_sequence()` function will save here. Only one morph sequence will be saved here, as any older files get overwritten. My procedure for creating a gif is to run my `morph_sequence()` function to get the frames, and then use gifmaker.me to create a gif.

results_for_webpage: all webpage content is in this folder

saved_points: these are .txt files containing correspondence points for the images I procured

Thanks!
